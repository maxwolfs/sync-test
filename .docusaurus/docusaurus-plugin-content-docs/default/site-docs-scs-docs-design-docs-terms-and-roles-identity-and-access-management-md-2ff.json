  "description": "The objective of this document is to define a basic set of roles and their identifiers / names in SCS. These roles can be used in the Identity and Access Management (IAM) of SCS itself and / or in services provided based on SCS. As Roles are often derived from Usecases which are derived from terms used in a project, the document starts with a definition of terms used in SCS and/or GAIA-X. These definitions should be moved into a separate document in the future.",
